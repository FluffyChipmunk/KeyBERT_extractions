471,Wears number eight.
472,I can't believe it.
473,Poor God.
474,"Oh, that's number three, isn't it?"
475,That's his leg.
476,Really?
477,It's his tentacles.
478,But that's a big word for a little guy.
479,Dude.
480,That wasn't very nice.
481,Mhm.
482,Let's bring these other guys a little closer for when it's time or?
483,"Ah, he's got my hand, he's got my hand."
484,"Look at that 1, 2, 3, 4, 567, 12, 3, 45."
485,He's got more than me.

488,How many fingers on each hand do you have?
489,That's right.
490,"Oh, that little baby is crazy."
491,"Oh, I know what's he doing?"
492,I don't know.
493,What are you doing?
494,You don't know either.

510,What are we gonna do about that?
511,Uh oh oh oh.
512,"Oh yeah, that one fell down too."
513,I know.
514,"Uh Should we do the boat next, should we do the boat as your next toy?"
515,What do you think?
516,I think we can get through the last two toys.
517,It was already like that when we got here.
518,But my guess would be this guy.
519,You.
520,"Oops, that's a boat."
521,"Oh, are you making the propeller go?"
522,"Oh, my goodness."
523,"That propeller spins and spins, doesn't it?"
524,Where is everybody going?
525,"Are you having a lot of fun, buddy?"
526,"Hey, how do you think?"
527,"I lost my eighth leg, dude."
528,Keep that propeller away from me.
529,That really spins.
530,Are you twisting the boy on top there?
531,And that makes the propeller spin?
532,"Oh, my goodness."
533,That is so interesting.
534,How are you making that?
535,Do that?
536,Yeah.
537,Oh.
538,"Oh, I know."
539,"Oh, yeah."
540,"That's really interesting to try to figure out, isn't it?"
541,I know.
542,I wonder if that would work in the water.
543,What do you think?
544,Do you think you would actually go in the water?
545,I don't know.
546,There's some holes in the bottom.
547,"It might just go glo, glo, glo, glo glob."
548,"Well, that's a really cool propeller."
549,"You got there, buddy."
550,B Wow.
551,"That toy is fascinating, isn't it?"
552,Oh.

556,"Went, went, went, went, went, went, went, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
557,Wow.
558,Right.
559,He's so yellow.
560,He's so yellow.
561,"Oh, my goodness."
562,"You're supposed to roast the duck before you eat him, dude."
563,What are you doing?
564,Uh.
565,"Ohh, poor duck."
566,What's the matter?
567,Did you want some tasty sauce to go with him?
568,Oh.
569,Oh.
570,Where did you go?
571,I don't know where he is.
572,Where is he?
573,Do I have a duck on my shoulder?

582,"Oh, there she is."
583,There's mommy.
584,"Good job, buddy."
